## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## 📝 Design Philosophy

This is a **design-focused implementation** where:
- Static UI is prioritized over business logic
- All data is mocked (marked with 🧪 Dummy Data comments)
- Interactions and animations showcase the user experience
- Components follow consistent patterns
- Code is production-quality for easy developer handoff

## 🎨 Design System

### Typography
- **Fraunces**: Headings and emphasis (with font variation settings)
- **Inter**: Body text and UI elements

### Colors
Using OKLCH color space with CSS variables for theming:
- Defined in `app/globals.css`
- Supports light and dark modes
- Semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, muted, etc.)

### Components
Built on ShadCN UI with custom styling:
- Button, Card, Badge
- Input, Textarea, Select
- Dropdown, Combobox
- Alert Dialog
- And more...

## ✨ Animation System

Powered by Framer Motion with pre-configured variants:

```tsx
import { AnimatedDiv } from '@/components/animations';
import { fadeInUp, staggerContainer } from '@/lib/animations';

<AnimatedDiv animation={fadeInUp} delay={0.2}>
  <YourComponent />
</AnimatedDiv>
```

**Available animations:**
- `fadeIn`, `fadeInUp`, `fadeInDown`
- `slideInLeft`, `slideInRight`
- `scaleIn`
- `staggerContainer`, `staggerItem`

## 📊 Mock Data

All mock data is centralized in `lib/data/`:

```tsx
import { mockCampaigns, mockMetrics, mockInsightCards } from '@/lib/data';
```

**Available data types:**
- Users
- Campaigns (Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Metrics and KPIs
- Insight cards
- Quick actions

## 🎨 Figma Integration

This project uses Figma MCP for design-to-code conversion:
1. Fetch designs from Figma
2. Convert to production-quality code
3. Match existing component patterns
4. Preserve visual design with Tailwind

## 📝 Code Annotations

```tsx
// 🔽 Section Header - Major UI sections
// 🧪 Dummy Data - Mock data to be replaced
// ✅ Reusable Component - Can be extracted
```

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

## 🎯 Current Implementation
